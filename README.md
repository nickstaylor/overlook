 ## Functionality

 Users can browse and search for available rooms in the hotel.  Users can search by date and also filter rooms by type.  The site keeps track of user bookings and total amount spent.  If Users find a room they like, they may book it!

 ### Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS/SCSS
* Mocha/Chai (testing)
* Vanilla JS
* JQuery


## Learning Goals

## Solidify and demonstrate understanding of the following:
* Testing Class Properties and Methods with Mocha/Chai
* Implement TDD
* Proper Set Up of Classes and Methods
* Separating updates to the DOM in a separate filte
* Creating functions and Methods with a single responsibility
* Fetching, Posting, and Deleting data from an API
* Data Restructuring


## Challenges

The biggest challenges of this project were setting up the class structure in a way that would keep the the data and methods from overlapping files.  There were tremendous challenges in setting up user and manager navigation and manipulation of data.  Also, refactoring methods into smaller methods to adhere to the SRP principle was a huge challenge.  Next steps include the completion of the SCSS portion of the project and also learning more about cross browser compatibility.  While I didn't complete the project, I learned so much more about testing, dataflow, classes/methods, and fetching.   

## Wins

The biggest win of this project was staying the course and slowly but surely implementing the necessary functionality to complete most of the iterations.  I completed most of the project on my own and while I ran into some roadblocks and ultimately ran out of time to complete everything, I am very happy with my effort.  I plan to continue working on this project and see it through to completion.
